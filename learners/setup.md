title: Setup

::: instructor

- The main goal here is to help the learners be comfortable with the RStudio
  interface.
- Go very slowly in the "Getting set up" section. Make sure everyone is following
  along (remind learners to use the stickies). Plan with the helpers at this
  point to go around the room, and be available to help. It's important to make
  sure that learners are in the correct working directory, and that they create
  a `data` (all lowercase) subfolder.

## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to your Desktop

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `spoiler`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
