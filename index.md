# Context

- Learning Objective 1: Explain why data visualization and creativity are vital tools in scientific research.
- Learning Objective 2: Comprehend why data visualization historically originated in the social sciences, including Du Bois' analyses that challenged false biological theories of racial inequality. 
- Learning Objective 3: Understand how Du Bois used visualizations to accessibly communicate findings to a broad audience.
- Learning Objective 4: Undrstand the benefits of a "team science" approach similar to that used by Du Bois.

# Implement: Create a Du Bois Bar Graph with R - Biodiversity and Redlining Data

- Learning Objective 1: Create bar graph variations based on historical and contemporary tabular data
- Learning Objective 2: Create R code that generates consistent and accurate visualizations based on different tabular data sets
- Learning Objective 3: Maintain a transparent, legible, and shareable record of how you created your own unique data visualizations
- Learning Objective 4: Implement your own creative ideas through data visualization based on tabular data sets
- Learning Objective 5: Re-create historical data visualizations into a digital environment with R coding
- Learning Objective 6: Improve the legibility and accessibility of data visualizations
- Learning Objective 7: Use ggplot to visualize tabular data as a function within R
- Learning Objective 8: Use color to improve legibility of findings from tabular data
