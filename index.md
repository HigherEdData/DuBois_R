This is a lesson for learning how to create scientific data visualizations in R.
The lesson uses examples from charts created by Black social scientist W.E.B. 
Du Bois and a diverse team of collaborators for the 1900 Paris World Expo.

The lesson is designed for learners with little or no programming experience. The
entire lesson can be taught in a two day workshop. Alternatively, selected
episodes from the lesson can be taught over a period of around 3 hours of lecture
and lab within a STEM course (see
[Instructor Notes](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-Data-Viz-with-Du-Bois/instructor/instructor-notes.html)
for suggested lesson plans). The episodes start with the social and scientific
context of the Du Bois visualizations, 

The Du Bois team's visualizations were state of the art in 1900, using most of
the major chart types still employed across the sciences and engineering today.
The Du Bois charts provided some of the first widely accessible scientific 
analyses to refute false, biologically based theories of racial inequality. For
their innovative analyses, beauty, and historical importance, the original 
hand drawn charts are preserved in the U.S. Library of Congress.

This lesson part of a series of **[STEM Data Visualization and Du Boisian Methods](https://github.com/HigherEdData/Du-Bois-STEM/tree/main)**
modules for learning data visualization in R, Python, Stata, and more. 
Development and testing of the modules is funded by the National Science Foundation.

## Getting Started

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.

**These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools.**

To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup](setup.html)" tab to
download data to your computer and follow any installation instructions.

#### Prerequisites

This lesson requires a working copy of **R** and **RStudio**.
<br>To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install
everything *before* working through this lesson.

# Context

- Learning Objective 1: Explain why data visualization and creativity are vital tools in scientific research.
- Learning Objective 2: Comprehend why data visualization historically originated in the social sciences, including Du Bois' analyses that challenged false biological theories of racial inequality. 
- Learning Objective 3: Understand how Du Bois used visualizations to accessibly communicate findings to a broad audience.
- Learning Objective 4: Undrstand the benefits of a "team science" approach similar to that used by Du Bois.

# Implement: Create a Du Bois Bar Graph with R - Biodiversity and Redlining Data

- Learning Objective 1: Create bar graph variations based on historical and contemporary tabular data
- Learning Objective 2: Create R code that generates consistent and accurate visualizations based on different tabular data sets
- Learning Objective 3: Maintain a transparent, legible, and shareable record of how you created your own unique data visualizations
- Learning Objective 4: Implement your own creative ideas through data visualization based on tabular data sets
- Learning Objective 5: Re-create historical data visualizations into a digital environment with R coding
- Learning Objective 6: Improve the legibility and accessibility of data visualizations
- Learning Objective 7: Use ggplot to visualize tabular data as a function within R
- Learning Objective 8: Use color to improve legibility of findings from tabular data
