## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.txt) for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/) for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a valid
Carpentries lesson template:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.
